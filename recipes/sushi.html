    <h1>Homemade Sushi Rolls</h1>
    <p><img src="../images/sushi.jpg" width="250" alt="Picture of Sushi"></p>
<p>Making sushi at home is surprisingly simple, and we will show you how to make sushi rolls.</p>
<p>With just enough practice, you will realize not only how easy sushi rolls are to make, but also how delicious they can be!</p>
<h3>New to making sushi rolls? No problem! Here's what you'll need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A bamboo rolling mat, <em>also known as a</em> makitsu</li>
        <li>Plastic wrap</li>
        <li>A sharp knife</li>
    </ul>

<h3><p>Ingredients for California Rolls:</p></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Nori sheets</li>
        <li>Crab meat (or imitation)</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Cucumber</li>
    </ul>
       <p><em>You can also mix the crab meat with a bit of mayo for a creamier texture. This is optional.</em></p>
<h4><p>A quick note on the rice:</p></h4>
    <p>Make sure to wash your rice before you cook it. A perfect wash looks like this:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put your rice in to a sieve and put a bowl or a pot in a sink.</li>
        <li>Wash your rice over the pot and keep washing it until your rice is soaked.</li>
        <li>Empty out the pot that has all of your rice water in it.</li>
        <li>Keep doing this process until the water in the pot eventually becomes clear (and not cloudy).</li>
    </ol>
<h3>How to make California Rolls:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the bamboo mat on a cutting board so that the bamboo strips are horizontally to you. </li>
        <li>Spread a strip of plastic wrap over the bamboo mat, then place a sheet (or half sheet, if it's too big) of nori on the plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori.</li>
        <li>Add your ingredients toward the center of the rice-covered nori.</li>
        <strong>Make sure to not over-pack it.</strong>
        <li>Lift the bottom of the mat up and over the sushi. (Don't rush it, take your time!)</li>
        Roll with pressure so you get a firm roll.
        <li>Keep rolling until just about an inch of the nori shows at the top. Seal the edge of the nori with a little cold water.</li>
        <li>Slice the sushi roll in half on a cutting board. Afterwards, cut each half into thirds (This should give you 6 pieces of sushi).</li>
    </ol>
